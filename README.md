# Module 2 Challenge

## Description

In this project I created a page to display my work for potential empoloyers. I used tools that I have learned over the past week to structure my page in HTML and to style my page using CSS. This project will be a showcase of the work that I do here in the UCF bootcamp and will constantly get better as I learn more. This is a work in progress.

## Navigation

You will be able to deploy the page using the link below:

https://thequentinjones.github.io/Module-2-Challenge/

Once there you will see my navigation bar with 3 other sections. Those sections are "About Me", "Projects", and "Contact Me". There are 6 clickable buttons on the page and 2 clickable images.
